## Technical brief
* 48 hour hack-a-thon in a paired group.
* **Have several components** - At least one classical and one functional.  
*  **The app can have a router** - with several "pages", this is up to your disgression and if it makes sense for your project.
* **Must use** a public API
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.

## Technologies:
* HTML5
* SCSS/CSS/Bulma
* ReactJS
* JavaScript (ES6)
* Insomnia
* MapBox
* 4 API Implementation

As we were both conscious of the absolute necessity to reduce the pollution levels in all major cities in the world, we decided to offer uses an efficient app returning:

-   Current Weather
-   Interactive Map with all available bike points
-   Information related to pollution metrics

---
## Processes
* To efficiently find our idea, we quickly came to an agreement on 3 different themes.
* From this point we actively searched for the APIs that were easely accessible, verifying the Data syntax through Insomnia.
* Once validated, VSCode offers the possibility to live share which we used to work on separated component, together.
* This was incredibly efficient as it allowed us to directly discuss & validate the way we wanted to structure or render our project.

## Challenges
* Implementing MapBox without being prior shown.
* Bulma - everything we tried was being overridden.

## Wins
* Calling 4 APIs within 48h in a React with no previous experience was a real challenge, therefore incredibly rewarding.
* Using my previous professional experiences to organise & ensure an efficient pair coding ; working all objectives with Brenda Ty was an absolute pleasure.

## Future development
* Working on 4 APIs was an incredible learning curve but to the cost of our render (SCSS).
* With more experience, Brenda Ty & myself will definitely revisit our App in order to offer a better product & user experience.
